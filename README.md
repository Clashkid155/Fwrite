## Fwrite
Just a basic Python script which creates a txt containing filenames of all file in a directory.

### Setup
Before running you have to change file directory and filename you want to store filenames in.

```
dir_name = 'Your directory name'

file_name = 'Name of save file'
```
Currently script only works on a precise file name format `Frank Nike, @Clashkid155` , will probably change later.

### Running
Simply type `python Fwrite.py` in your terminal.


### Todo.
- [ ] Remove all hard code.

### Why i wrote this ?
I needed a way to write all filenames in a directory to a file so i came up with this. I also need Github to hold it for me üòÅ.
